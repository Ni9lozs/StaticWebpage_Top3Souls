            <p>
                Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice[a] is a 2019 action-adventure game developed by 
                FromSoftware and published by Activision. The game follows a shinobi known 
                as Wolf as he attempts to take revenge on a samurai clan who attacked him and 
                kidnapped his lord. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and 
                Xbox One in March 2019 and for Stadia in October 2020.

                Gameplay is focused on stealth, exploration, and combat, with a particular emphasis on 
                boss battles. The game takes place in a fictionalized Japan set during the Sengoku 
                period and makes strong references to Buddhist mythology and philosophy. While creating 
                the game, lead director Hidetaka Miyazaki wanted to create a new intellectual property 
                (IP) that marked a departure from the Souls series of games also made by FromSoftware. 
                The game looked to series such as The Mysterious Murasame Castle and Tenchu for inspiration.

                Sekiro was praised by critics, complimenting its gameplay and setting and compared it to the 
                Souls games, although opinions on its difficulty were mixed. It was nominated for various 
                awards and won several, including The Game Award for Game of the Year. The game sold over 
                five million copies by July 2020.
