                Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is an action-adventure game developed by Respawn Entertainment 
                and published by Electronic Arts. It was released for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One 
                in November 2019, for Stadia in November 2020, and for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and 
                Series S in June 2021. The story, set in the Star Wars universe five years after Star Wars: 
                Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, follows Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis, who becomes a target of 
                the Galactic Empire and is hunted throughout the galaxy by two Inquisitors while attempting to 
                complete his training, escape his troubled past, and rebuild the fallen Jedi Order.
