                    This is the voiceline in the trailer of Dark Souls: Remastered.

                <p>
                "Woman voice: Yes, indeed. The Dark sign brands the undead. And in this land,
                the Undead are corralled and led to the North, where they are locked away to
                await the end of the world. This is your fate.
                </p>
                <p>
                Man voice: Well, what do we have here? You must be a new arrival. Let me guess,
                fate of the Undead, right? You'd have done better to rot in the Undead Asylum.
                Don't even consider visiting Anor Londo, not in your state. You won't stand a chance.
                You'll be eaten alive. Go along if you wish, if you want to ignore despair.

                Clinging to his Age of Fire and in dire fear of humans and the Dark Lord,
                who would have one day be born amongst them, Lord Gwyn resisted the course
                of nature....
                </p>
                <p>
                so that you may link the fire...cast away the dark...and undo the course
                of the Undead...and may the Age of Fire perpetuate."

                <p>Trailer of the game.
                    In the beginning of the video, we are in some mystical corridor, full of prison cells. Then, we see the hero of the game, who is locked up in prison. He is an <i>undead</i>, which is a kind of curse, the person cannot die. Then, we see <b>Firelink Shrine</b>, which is basically the centre of the game. There, a knight tells you, you have to ring the two bells of awakening, and visualizes the things you have to go through. There are huge monsters that kill you with a thorn, and catacombs where you can be killed by skeletons, or even getting killed by magic. You can see fire monsters underneath the ground, magical knights, and dragons as well. Then, the knight tells you that you may link to the fire, which is basically you sacrifising yourself in order to break the curse.
