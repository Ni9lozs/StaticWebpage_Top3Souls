              <h2>About the game</h2>
            <p>
                Dark Souls[c] is a 2011 action role-playing game developed by 
                FromSoftware and published by Namco Bandai Games. A spiritual 
                successor to FromSoftware's Demon's Souls, the game is the second 
                installment in the Souls series. Dark Souls takes place in the kingdom 
                of Lordran, where players assume the role of a cursed undead character 
                who begins a pilgrimage to discover the fate of their kind. A port for 
                Microsoft Windows was released in August 2012, which featured additional 
                content not seen in the original PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. 
                The content was released for consoles in October 2012 under the subtitle 
                Artorias of the Abyss.

                Dark Souls has been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. 
                Critics praised the depth of its combat, intricate level design, and use 
                of flavor text. However, the game's difficulty received mixed reviews, 
                with some criticizing it for being too unforgiving. The original Windows 
                version of the game was less well-received, with criticism directed at 
                several technical issues. By April 2013, the game had sold over two million 
                copies worldwide. Two sequels were released in the mid-2010s, while a remastered 
                version was released in 2018.
